In a way, it's a kind of nonsense word – playfully adapted to describe a travel phenomenon that was already out there when Walt Whitman wrote, \"I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this way, as we throw our wealth at an abstract notion called \"lifestyle,\" travel becomes just another accessory – a smooth-edged, encapsulated experience that we purchase the same way we buy clothing and furniture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of us, of course, have never taken such vows – but we choose to live like monks anyway, rooting ourselves to a home or a career and using the future as a kind of phony ritual that justifies the present.
